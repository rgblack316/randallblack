If you’re using a network storage device with SMB shares, automating the process with <strong>AppleScript</strong> and <strong>Apple Shortcuts</strong> can save time. In this guide, we’ll walk you through using AppleScript to map network drives and set up an Apple Shortcut to run the script effortlessly.</p><p>We’ll be using the following IP address and share names:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>IP Address</strong>: <code>192.168.1.100</code></li>\n<li><strong>SMB Shares</strong>: <code>Podcast</code>, <code>Personal</code>, and <code>Music</code></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A macOS device running <strong>macOS Monterey or later</strong> (for Apple Shortcuts).  </li>\n<li>Access to the SMB shares on your network storage device (correct credentials and permissions).  </li>\n<li>Basic familiarity with <strong>AppleScript</strong> and <strong>Apple Shortcuts</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"step-1-write-the-applescript-to-mount-smb-drives\">Step 1: Write the AppleScript to Mount SMB Drives</h2>\n<p>AppleScript is a powerful scripting tool built into macOS that allows for automation. Let’s create a script that mounts the <code>Podcast</code>, <code>Personal</code>, and <code>Music</code> SMB shares hosted on the device at <code>192.168.1.100</code>.</p><p>Here’s the AppleScript to mount the shares:</p><pre><code class=\"language-applescript\">-- Define a handler to connect to SMB shares\non mountSMBShare(shareName)\n    try\n        set serverAddress to &quot;smb://192.168.1.100/&quot; &amp; shareName\n        mount volume serverAddress\n    on error errMsg\n        display dialog &quot;Failed to mount &quot; &amp; shareName &amp; &quot;: &quot; &amp; errMsg buttons {&quot;OK&quot;} default button &quot;OK&quot;\n    end try\nend mountSMBShare\n\n-- Mount the Podcast, Personal, and Music shares\nmountSMBShare(&quot;Podcast&quot;)\nmountSMBShare(&quot;Personal&quot;)\nmountSMBShare(&quot;Music&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-this-script\">How to Use This Script</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <strong>Script Editor</strong> on your Mac (<code>Applications</code> &gt; <code>Utilities</code> &gt; <code>Script Editor</code>).</li>\n<li>Paste the AppleScript code above.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save</strong>, and save the script as <code>MountSMBDrives.scpt</code>.

            "content_html": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction:</h2>\n<p>In the vast realm of managing technology resources, there comes a time when one needs to install software and drivers on a Windows system seamlessly. One invaluable tool in this process is Audit Mode, a hidden gem that allows for customization before the system is finalized. In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to boot Windows into Audit Mode and efficiently install the necessary components for a smooth computing experience.</p><h3 id=\"understanding-audit-mode\">Understanding Audit Mode:</h3>\n<p>Before delving into the process, let’s grasp the concept of Audit Mode. It’s essentially a state in which you can customize a Windows installation before any user accounts are created, making it ideal for IT professionals, educators, and tech enthusiasts who want to tailor a system to specific needs.</p><h3 id=\"step-1-initial-windows-installation\">Step 1: Initial Windows Installation:</h3>\n<p>Start by installing Windows as you normally would. When you reach the out-of-box experience (OOBE), press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F3</strong> simultaneously. This magical key combination will usher you into Audit Mode without creating a user account.</p><h3 id=\"step-2-tweaking-and-customization\">Step 2: Tweaking and Customization:</h3>\n<p>Once in Audit Mode, you’ll find yourself on the desktop with the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep) dialog open. Fear not; this is your gateway to customization. Before making any changes, consider creating a system backup to avoid potential mishaps.</p><p>Now, feel free to install software, drivers, and make any necessary adjustments to the system. This is where your expertise as a technology specialist comes into play. Customize to your heart’s content!</p><h3 id=\"step-3-sysprep-and-generalization\">Step 3: Sysprep and Generalization:</h3>\n<p>After tweaking, it’s time to prepare the system for deployment. Launch Sysprep using the command <strong>C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysprep\\Sysprep.exe</strong>. Choose the ‘Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)’ option and ensure that the ‘Generalize’ box is checked. Click ‘OK,’ and Sysprep will work its magic.</p><h3 id=\"step-4-rebooting-into-audit-mode\">Step 4: Rebooting into Audit Mode:</h3>\n<p>Once Sysprep completes its task, the system will shut down. Now, when you boot the machine again, Windows will enter Audit Mode. This time, however, it will be a generalized system ready for deployment.</p><p>Here’s where the process transforms from the mundane to the marvelous. It’s like orchestrating a symphony of technology, ensuring every note (or line of code) plays harmoniously in your customized Windows ensemble. Think of it as a backstage pass to the inner workings of your operating system – a privilege bestowed upon tech virtuosos.</p><h3 id=\"step-5-completing-oobe-and-user-account-creation\">Step 5: Completing OOBE and User Account Creation:</h3>\n<p>Upon reboot, Windows will resume the out-of-box experience, but fear not – your customizations remain intact. Complete the OOBE process by creating your user account and finishing the setup. Your system is now a finely tuned masterpiece, tailored precisely to your specifications.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, mastering tools like Audit Mode empowers educators, technology specialists, and anyone seeking a personalized computing experience. The ability to install software and drivers with precision before finalizing a Windows installation is a game-changer.</p><p>So, fellow tech maestros, embrace the symphony of customization, let the keys of Ctrl, Shift, and F3 guide you, and may your Windows installations be harmonious and tailored to perfection!</p>",
